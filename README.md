# Student-Result-Management-Portal
  • Created a management portal for admin to store various data of students and to help student’s check their own
    details.
    
  • Students now have the option to search for their data, and administrators may also update or list student
    information and outcomes.
    
  • Utilized MySQL database to store and retrieve data entered through the GUI.
  
  • Developed the application using Java Swing, AWT and MySQL.
